## Features

* AES-256-CBC encryption with salt and hash verification
* ChaCha20 stream cipher implementation
* RSA public-key cryptography
* Elliptic Curve (EC-256) cryptography
* SHA-512 hashing functionality
* Secure packet encryption (basic and enhanced)
* Asynchronous communication module
* Configuration management utilities

## Requirements

* Python 3.6+
* pycryptodome
* cryptography

## Installation

```bash
pip install EnigmaVaultCrypt
```

## Basic Usage Example

```python
from EnigmaVaultCrypt import AES256CBCEngine

# Generate key and initialization vector
key, iv = AES256CBCEngine.generate_aes_256_cbc_bytes()

# Encrypt data
encrypted_data = AES256CBCEngine.encrypt_aes_256_cbc("Secret message", key, iv)

# Decrypt data
decrypted_data = AES256CBCEngine.decrypt_aes_256_cbc(encrypted_data, key, iv)
```
